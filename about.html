          <h2>Thanks for visiting my site</h2>
          <p>Life started on a hot July day in Perth Amboy, NJ. According to my mom I couldn't wait to arrive. I was born in 
        the waiting room of the hospital because they didn't have time to get the delivery room ready. I spent my 
        next 18 years in the same house and town. It was a typical childhood, friends, games, sports, and school.</p>
        <p>I attended Indiana University and gained a BS in Public Management. While I was there I explored many new 
          social and emotional pursuits. I graduated and decided to move back to NJ and start my career as a Customer 
          Service Representative for an online brokerage firm. That job taught me a lot but for the next few years 
          I was uncertain of my future career. I tried a few roles and realized that selling things was something 
          I was really good at. In 2007 I met my wife at a July 4th party, we bought a house, had 2 kids then 
          decided the rat race of NYC wasn't for us. We moved to Charlotte in 2014 and haven't looked back. I 
          am currentnly exploring a new opportunity as a Full-Stack Developer. I am really excited 
          and looking foward to seeing what the future holds.</p>
