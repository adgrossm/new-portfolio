          <h2>Thanks for visiting my site</h2>
          <p>Life started on a hot July day in Perth Amboy, NJ. According to my mom I couldn't wait to arrive. I was
            born in
            the waiting room of the hospital because they didn't have time to get the delivery room ready. I spent my
            next 18 years in the same house and town. It was a typical childhood, friends, games, sports, and school.
